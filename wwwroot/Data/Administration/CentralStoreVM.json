As per the Gujarat State Procurement Policy, 2024, purchases above prescribed limits on GeM require approval from the designated Purchase Committees (DPC/DPCAD). The policy also clearly defines the financial powers of these committees for routine and higher-value purchases, ensuring accountability and compliance with state and central procurement norms.",
